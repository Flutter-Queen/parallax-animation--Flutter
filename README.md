# parallax-animation--Flutter

A parallax scrolling effect is achieved by slightly pushing the background image in the opposite direction of the rest of the list. As the list items slide up the screen, each background image slides slightly downward. Conversely, as the list items slide down the screen, each background image slides slightly upward. Visually, this results in parallax.
